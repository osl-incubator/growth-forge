# Contributing

In order to be able to contribute, it is important that you understand the
project layout. This project uses the _src layout_, which means that the package
code is located at `./src/growth_forge`.

For my information, check the official documentation:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/

In addition, you should know that to build our package we use
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), it's a Python package management tool that
simplifies the process of building and publishing Python packages. It allows us
to easily manage dependencies, virtual environments and package versions. Poetry
also includes features such as dependency resolution, lock files and publishing
to PyPI. Overall, Poetry streamlines the process of managing Python packages,
making it easier for us to create and share our code with others.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

  welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here’s how to set up `growth-forge` for local development.

1.  Fork the `growth-forge` repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/growth-forge.git
```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use `mamba` to create a Conda environment and`poetry` for managing Python dependencies.

```bash
$ cd growth-forge/  # in the case you are not in the root of the project
$ mamba env create --file conda/dev.yaml
$ conda activate growth-forge
$ poetry install
```

4.  Create a branch for local development:

```bash
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5.  When you’re done making changes, check that your changes pass the linter and
    the tests:

```bash
$ makim tests.unit
$ makim tests.linter
```

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Configurations before working on Growth-Forge

1. If you don't have Docker installed, you can visit the following page:
   [click here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and follow the
   steps. Do not forget to see the steps of post install
   [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

2. Run the following command:

```bash
$ sugar build
```
3. It is important to run the command:

```bash
$ makim django.migrate
```
This command is executed to apply migrations based on the current migration files.

4.  To create a superuser, you should use the following commands with your information:

```bash
$ makim django.create-superuser --email
$ makim django.create-superuser --username
$ makim django.create-superuser --password
```

5. Run the comand to execute Django:

```bash
$ sugar ext start --options -d
```

or

```bash
$ sugar ext restart --options -d
```

The project will be accessible at `localhost:8000`.

6. To view all logs, you can execute the following command:

```bash
$ sugar ext restart --options
```

The command mentioned is used to restart the project, which can be useful when registering a new user.

After adding a new user, you should check the console for the email verification link. To complete the email verification, click on the link, which will open in your browser. There, you will see the option to verify the email. This step is crucial to ensure the email address is valid and active, enabling the new user to fully utilize their account.

7. Once you have accessed the verification link and verified your email, you can navigate through the menu of the project "growth-forge." This menu will likely offer various options related to project settings.


## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your
    new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to
    the list in README.rst.
3.  The pull request should work for Python >= 3.8.

## Release

This project uses semantic-release in order to cut a new release based on the
commit-message.

### Commit message format

**semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact
of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit
messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next
[semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and
publishes the release.

By default, **semantic-release** uses
[Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).
The commit message format can be changed with the `preset` or `config` options\_
of the
[@semantic-release/commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer#options)
and
[@semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator#options)
plugins.

Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or
[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) can be used
to help contributors and enforce valid commit messages.

The table below shows which commit message gets you which release type when
`semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                 | Release type     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when pressure is applied` | Fix Release      |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                     | Feature Release  |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option`                    | Chore            |
| `feat(pencil)!: The graphiteWidth option has been removed`     | Breaking Release |

<https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/README.md#commit-message-format>

As this project uses the `squash and merge` strategy, ensure to apply the commit
message format to the PR's title.
