# Installation

## Stable release

To install Feedback Linker, run this command in your
terminal:

```bash
$ pip install feedback-linker
```

This is the preferred method to install Feedback Linker,
as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this
[Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.
